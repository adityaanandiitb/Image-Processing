We aim to explore the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their suitability for image classification tasks. We will understand the significance of automatic feature learning in image classification and how CNNs excel in utilizing spatial relationships within images. To Do: a. You will have to to successfully run this notebook and understand the steps. b. Make any modifications/additions to demonstrate that the model trained correctly, by using an image from the 'Test' dataset and verify that it was correctly classified. c. Take an image of a your own handwritten digit (possibly in a 5cm x 5cm sheet) and verify if the model is able to classify it correctly. If it fails, justify the reason. d. Take images of a specific digit, one from the 'train' and 'test' set. Extract the SIFT features for these digits. Compare them using their SIFT features and verify if they match. Justify. e. Create a copy of this notebook and now use the CIFAR10 dataset and modify the template (keep the basic model same as 'Sequential', but can make other changes) as necessary to perform classification on this dataset. Show that the trained model is able to classify the objects from the given 'Train' set. Does it work for your own image (not necessarily in the dataset)
